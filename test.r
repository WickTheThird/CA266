# Introduction to R

# Assigning variables

x <- 7 # or 7 -> x, but we prefer the first way
print(7)

# We can assign a range of variables

x <- 1:4 # We can multiply this range by a number
print(x)
b <- x*10
print(b)

# We can get fast help in R by typing
# either help.start() (this opening the entire docs)
# or ?(name_of_function) or in case you vaguely know
# the name of the function you can write apropos("vague_name")
# then a list of possible names will apear and if you forgot what it
# does then just somply use "?"

apropos("att")

?attach()

# You can also assign data
